    brief:
      "Merge sort is a sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer approach. It works by recursively dividing the input array into smaller subarrays and sorting those subarrays then merging them back together to obtain the sorted array. : In simple terms, we can say that the process of merge sort is to divide the array into two halves, sort each half, and then merge the sorted halves back together. This process is repeated until the entire array is sorted.",

    applications: [
      "External Sorting - Used in sorting large datasets that do not fit in memory, such as database sorting and file systems.",
      "Linked Lists - Preferred for sorting linked lists since it does not require random access and works efficiently with node-based structures.",

Divide:

[38, 27]  is divided into  [38]  and  [27]  . 
[43, 10]  is divided into  [43]  and  [10]  . 
Conquer: 


[38]  is already sorted. 
[27]  is already sorted. 
[43]  is already sorted. 
[10]  is already sorted. 
Merge: 


Merge  [38]  and  [27]  to get  [27, 38]  . 
Merge  [43]  and  [10]  to get  [10,43]  . 
Merge  [27, 38]  and  [10,43]  to get the final sorted list  [10, 27, 38, 43] 
Therefore, the sorted list is  [10, 27, 38, 43]  . `,
